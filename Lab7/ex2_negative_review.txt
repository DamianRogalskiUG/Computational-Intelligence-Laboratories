the price of our room was so expensive for what we got… the room had no bathroom and the bathroom that was shared was dirty. the fact that there was no bathroom in the hotel and we had to share it with random people during Covid really gave me the ick. I would even understand if there was someone cleaning it every so often but that was not the case! also there was only one bathroom and so many people on the floor! the towel hook wasn’t even close to the shower so you had to step on the dirty floor like uhhhh no thanks.
I really didnt like that at all. I hate this place. I will never come here again. The owner must be out of his mind. I hate it all. My visit there was awfult. I HATE HATE HATE IT!
