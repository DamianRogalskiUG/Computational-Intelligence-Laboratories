It was a great stay, the location is amazing, right next to Central Park, close to a subway station (Columbus Circle), with plenty of shops nearby. The room we booked had everything we needed - a bunk bed was a little bit squeaky but comfortable, there was a big mirror, an open wardrobe, a big chair, a desk and a fridge. Bathrooms were always clean and private, never had to wait for a free one. No problems with wifi.
